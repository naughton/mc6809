The following info is taken straight from the Williams booklet on Defender.


BOOKKEEPING AND EVALUATION TOTALS (Functions 1-7)
=================================================
1. In game over mode, set switch to AUTO-UP and depress ADVANCE. The CRT
   indicates Function 1 and total left chute coins.
2. Record audit totals and depress ADVANCE for functions 1-7. To review a
   total that has been advanced past, set switch to MANUAL-DOWN and depress
   ADVANCE. Functions are displayed one at a time as follows:-

      Function    Total    Description
      --------------------------------
		 1          0      (Total) COINS LEFT
         2          0      (Total) COINS CENTER
         3          0      (Total) COINS RIGHT
         4          0      TOTAL PAID (Games)
         5          0      (Total Bonus) SHIPS WON
         6          0      TOTAL (Play) TIME (Minutes)
         7          0      TOTAL SHIPS (Played)
			
3. Operate ADVANCE to display Function 28, SPECIAL FUNCTION. From Function
   28 you can return to game over or zero audit totals and return to game
   over.
4. With switch set to AUTO-UP, perform a. or b. as desired.
      a. To return to game over depress ADVANCE.
      b. To zero audit totals and return to game over, operate HIGH SCORE
         RESET to indicate "35" on CRT Function 28 and then depress ADVANCE.

GAME ADJUSTMENTS (Functions 8-27)
=================================
1. In game over mode set switch to AUTO_UP and then depress ADVANCE. The CRT
   indicates Function 1 and total left chute coins.
2. To raise Function number on CRT, operate ADVANCE pushbutton with switch
   set to AUTO-UP. To lower Function number operate ADVANCE with it set to
   MANUAL-DOWN.
3. With desired Function indicated, raise adjustment value by operating HIGH
   SCORE RESET with switch set to AUTO-UP; lower value by operating HIGH
   SCORE RESET with it set to MANUAL-DOWN. Value left on CRT is new setting.

Well thats it for the Special Functions, I hope you find this of use :-)

I have been trying to find out more info on the company producing this
MAC emulator as I would love to get hold of it for my Amiga. Does anyone
know if they are going to do it or not? If they are not, then I would be
very interested in converting it for them as I am a programmer by trade.
Any help with this quest would be much appreciated.
